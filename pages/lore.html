                    <p>Opening one's eye, commonly referred to as activation, is achieved by simultaneously acknowledging the presence of the third eye (via makeup, physical touch, or concentrating on the area) and channeling rage into it. This raw, unpleasant process was inspired by Maynard's performance of TOOL's song “Third Eye”: which combines powerful vocal energy with an lyrical acknowledgement of the eye.</p>
                    <p>Upon activation, the eyes turn red after a few minutes and the third eye site will bleed for a while. Initial activation may induce headaches, nosebleeds, light sensitivity, dizziness, or fainting. Covering the third eye may result in dangerous bursts of energy or site irritation.
                        While in an activated state, common side effects include dehydration, fatigue, pain and bleeding at the site, dizziness, and nausea.</p>
                        <p>Symptoms may worsen depending on one's emotional state.
                        Activated individuals will experience a light red glow around the body accompanied by floating red eyes (when a person is angry, annoyed, or embarrassed). These glowing eye markings may also appear on the palms of one's hands, at the site, or across the body like tattoos.
                        Third eye scar markings, floating eye shapes, and supernatural abilities vary and are unique to each person. Some people have more abilities or more unwanted side effects than others. Powers include mind-reading, intrusion, or manipulation, telepathy, telekinesis, levitation, clairvoyance, seeing into the future, healing, invisibility, and energy projection. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The spell of activation usually wears off within 24 hours. Once a person is no longer activated, all visual indicators, side effects, and supernatural abilities disappear. Subsequent activations may go smoother than the initial activation.</p>
                    <p>The Third Mind is a parasitic demonic entity accidentally summoned by Serj. It can be representative of one's traumas, intrusive thoughts, or addictions and gains its power through fear. Page 36 of John's book has more information. Daron got one too that turned out to be harmless. I want to retcon this idea though.</p>

                    <p>Here are some fun facts and trivia about Third Eye:</p>
                        <li>Shavo (IRL!) has reposted my Third Eye art three times!</li>
                        <li>Daron's Third Mind triangle is kinda pointless. I regret creating it because it really had no purpose in the plot.</li>
                        <li>Shavo's power was spontaneously developed while drawing the panels leading up to the reveal.</li>
                        <li>Shavo's tattoos only spread to others who have activated.</li>
                        <li>John's redemption arc was inspired by a direct request for it in my Third Eye AMA.</li>
                        <li>The Third Mind quotes songs like "Pet" (A Perfect Circle) and "Third Eye" (TOOL).</li>
                        <li>John's phone is a Nokia 6110, and his car is a 1979 Chevrolet K5 Blazer.</li>
                        <li>John's glasses alleviate his activation symptoms and suppress all visual effects. This lore was only developed because in my Instagram comments asked about their significance.</li>
                        <li>Shavo's camo pants and Puma shoes are circa 2002. Oops. </li>
                        <li>Artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_kamsandwich/?hl=en" target="_blank">@_kamsandwich</a> is the only other character in the story.</li>
                        <li>The pizza place uses the font of TOOL's Fear Inoculum album.</li>
                        <li>Up until the very end, I had no idea how they were going to kill the mind. The original “final idea” was a ritual of them performing Sugar again all wearing the same war paint.</li>
                </ul>
