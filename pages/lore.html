                    <p>Opening one's eye, commonly referred to as activation, is achieved by simultaneously acknowledging the presence of the third eye (via makeup, physical touch, or concentrating on the area) and channeling rage into it. This raw, unpleasant process was inspired by Maynard's performance of TOOL's song “Third Eye”: which combines powerful vocal energy with an lyrical acknowledgement of the eye.</p>
                    <p>Upon activation, the eyes turn red after a few minutes and the third eye site will bleed for a while. Initial activation may induce headaches, nosebleeds, light sensitivity, dizziness, or fainting. Covering the third eye may result in dangerous bursts of energy or site irritation.
                        While in an activated state, common side effects include dehydration, fatigue, pain and bleeding at the site, dizziness, and nausea.</p>
                        <p>Symptoms may worsen depending on one's emotional state.
                        Activated individuals will experience a light red glow around the body accompanied by floating red eyes (when a person is angry, annoyed, or embarrassed). These glowing eye markings may also appear on the palms of one's hands, at the site, or across the body like tattoos.
                        Third eye scar markings, floating eye shapes, and supernatural abilities vary and are unique to each person. Some people have more abilities or more unwanted side effects than others. Powers include mind-reading, intrusion, or manipulation, telepathy, telekinesis, levitation, clairvoyance, seeing into the future, healing, invisibility, and energy projection. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The spell of activation usually wears off within 24 hours. Once a person is no longer activated, all visual indicators, side effects, and supernatural abilities disappear. Subsequent activations may go smoother than the initial activation.</p>
                    <p>The Third Mind is a parasitic demonic entity accidentally summoned by Serj. It can be representative of one's traumas, intrusive thoughts, or addictions and gains its power through fear. Page 36 of John's book has more information. Daron got one too that turned out to be harmless. I want to retcon this idea though.</p>
