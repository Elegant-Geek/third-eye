            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>Third Eye is a cool little SOAD AU sketchbook comic I spent 6 months on from start to finish (1.31.24 - 6.29.24). This timeline encompasses the full scope of idea generation, story brainstorming, development, and revising, concept sketch generation, drawing, inking, and posting. It is a supernatural story that follows Serj, Daron, Shavo, and John as they open their third eyes and face the unpredictable and sometimes dangerous consequences of doing so. Third Eye itself was a completely spontaneous comic idea that came from a variety of inspirations including a fellow SOAD artist's DTIYS and its resulting contributions, TOOL's song “Third Eye”, and some doodles I had done of Serj with some floating eyes way back in January.</p>
            <p>The story started off as completely improvisational with very little planning and later progressed to a clipboard of general ideas, lore building, and main plot points. After completing Third Eye, I played around with the idea of the other members opening their eyes and what that would look like, and thus the development for the sequel Third Mind begun. This sequel was everything I wished Third Eye had been: less expositional and more plot/conflict focused with darker elements. Not long after developing a neat twist and epilogue for this part, The Spiral was being crafted from start to finish in an 18,000 word long Word doc. The writing alone took over a month and resulted in 85 pages of drawings!</p>
            <p>The conflict of the story is driven by a mix of demonic entities, internal conflict, and interpersonal conflict (super fun to write). By focusing on what each band member wants and how they work to get what they want really strengthened the plot. I also really enjoyed writing cliffhangers.</p>
